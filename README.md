I’m an enthusiastic and motivated Computer Science undergraduate at the University of London, eager to apply my skills and grow through real-world projects. With a solid foundation in multiple programming languages and frameworks, I’m passionate about problem-solving and continuous learning. I love developing impactful software, collaborating on projects, and exploring the intersection of AI, data science, and web development.
